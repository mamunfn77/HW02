    <p>When thinking about data analytics, we often associate how data is collected and analyzed for use in business or science. For example, sales and customer data are collected by companies to improve future sales and customer engagement.</p>
    <p>Data analytics can also be used to collect personal information, and when used correctly, that data can be very beneficial for improving your personal life. You may already be collecting personal data through a smartphone or smartwatch and utilizing that to improve your health.
       In this post, you’ll learn just how crunching the numbers isn’t just for companies and how personal life data analytics can be used to improve your health, money management, and daily routine.</p>
    <b>What Is Data Analytics?</b>
    <p>Data analytics is the process of analyzing raw data to discover insights for a specific purpose. For example, data analytics could be used to maximize business profits by identifying customers’ needs and gaps in the market, or they can be used to track your personal biometrics and fitness goals.</p>
    <b>How Data Analytics Impact Your Daily Life</b>
    <p>Data analytics can be used for professional and personal purposes through various tools such as spreadsheets, data visualization tools, and even insights displayed on apps. Data is all around us and has become an essential part of our daily lives. For instance, cell phones constantly collect usage data, and social media apps store engagement insights such as likes, comments, and views. We're tracked by businesses looking to target us for advertisements, and we track our own analytics in efforts to improve ourselves. Your data is being collected, in one way or another, every day. So you have to ask yourself — are you going to make use of it?</p>
    <b>Improving Your Personal Life With Data Analytics</b>
    <p>Whether it's your goal to get more hours of sleep a night or ramp up your fitness this year, data analytics can help you evaluate and improve your daily life. Here, you’ll find various ways to adopt data analysis to help you learn more about your habits.</p>
    <b>Organizing Your Finances</b>
    <p>Analyzing your financial data, like tracking your expenses, can help you budget and create financial awareness. Learning more about how and where you spend money can highlight unhealthy habits that you may want to change. The Mint app can be a great way to learn your spending habits and manage your budget.</p>
    <b>Improving Personal Health</b>
    <p>Using data to track your health is a great way to stay on top of your sleeping pattern, nutrition, and exercise routine. Whether your fitness goals are to get more movement or to track the number of calories you eat, collecting health data can help you make positive changes. One way to track health metrics is to use Fitbit, which allows you to track the number of steps you walk, your heart rate, and hours of sleep.</p>
    <b>Managing Your Time</b>
    <p>Managing your time is one of the most beneficial ways to look after your own being because time is one thing you will never be able to get back. Take advantage of time management tools to evaluate how you spend your work and personal time. Apps like Fiverr Workspace can help you record your work tasks to better manage projects and your entire day.</p>
    <b>Monitoring Your Social Media Use</b>
    <p>Social media networks have become incredibly popular, as they help to discover entertainment, art, and the ability to connect with others on a global scale. Collecting personal data on your online habits can help you to collect data on how to be more productive, as social media networks can be a time suck if you spend hours a day on them. The Forest app helps track the time you spend online, highlighting the periods where you’re more focused to boost your productivity.</p>
    <b>Data Is the New Currency</b>
    <p>In the digital age, data has become the new currency and can have value in helping businesses grow, alongside helping us grow as human beings. By understanding the data in our personal lives, we can gain more control over it. Furthermore, personal data can be utilized to drastically improve our health, relationships, and overall habits to help us meet our goals.</p>
